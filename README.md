Time spent: **x** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** user stories are complete:

- [x] User can tab an image to view a larger image in a detail view (5pts)

The following **stretch** user stories are implemented:

- [ ] Add Avatar and Publish Dates (+2pt)
- [ ] Zoomable Photo View (+2pt)
- [ ] Infinite Scrolling (+2pt)

The following **additional** user stories are implemented:

- [x] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality! (+1-3pts)
To improve the app's functionality a search bar or a way to filter results from different tumblr accounts could be implemented. A sign in option to view your own tumblr feed would also greatly improve the functionality of the app.

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):
I would like to discuss the api calls further with my peers as well as how to pass values between screens. Although I was able to complete the assignment, this is where I struggled the most.
